                <h3> SHANG DYNASTY</h3>
				<h2> 1600BC - 1046BC </h2>
                <p>There was no actual porcelain in China prior to the Shang Dynasty, people all utilized earthenware as a storage item at that time. From the Paleolithic to the Neolithic eras, the invention of pottery is one of the most prominent symbols of human civilization. While from the Shang Dynasty, a transitional category from pottery to porcelain was invented, known as white porcelain. Despite the fact that white porcelain is categorized as porcelain, the embryo body and glaze layer fire processes are both rough. And because of the low firing temperature, it is commonly referred to as a kind of "original porcelain." We also usually regard it as 1.0 version of Chinese porcelain.

                <h3>TANG DYNASTY</h3>
				<h2> 618AD - 917AD </h2>
                <p>In Tang Dynasty, porcelain production technology and its artistic creation both reached the first peak of Chinese ceramic history. There are three main types of porcelain in the Tang Dynasty: celadon, white porcelain (different from the one in the Shang Dynasty), and Tri-glazed pottery. Both celadon and white porcelain are fired in fixed regional kilns: YUE kiln is responsible for celadon, XING kiln is responsible for white porcelain. At that time, the development of Chinese porcelain in the Tang Dynasty gradually formed the regional characteristics of celadon in the south and white in the north. Tri-glazed pottery of the Tang Dynasty is another branch of the development of ancient porcelain, and also a very famous porcelain category at that time.

                <h3>SONG DYNASTY</h3>
				<h2>960AD - 1279AD</h2>
                <p>In the Song Dynasty, there was new improvement in fetal quality, glaze material and production technology, and porcelain firing technology reached a fully mature level. The Chinese porcelain industry reached its peak in the Song Dynasty. Compared with the Tang Dynasty, porcelains in the Song Dynasty were of various types and are also breakthroughs in decoration methods.
                    Many star kilns sprang up throughout the country. Eight famous kilns of song Dynasty: Ru Kiln, Ge Kiln, Guan kiln, Ding Kiln, Jian kiln, Jingdezhen, Jun Kiln, Yaozhou kiln.

                <h3>YUAN DYNASTY</h3>
				<h2>1271AD - 1368AD</h2>
                <p>From the Yuan Dynasty, the era of a hundred schools of porcelain came to an end, turning into a situation where Jingdezhen was the most famous kiln in Yuan Dynasty, with 90percent produced here. During this dynasty, Jingdezhen invented blue and white porcelain, which is the most popular kind of Chinese porcelain in the world. Besides the blue and white porcelain, they also produced a red version, called underglaze red. Occupying almost all the porcelain market with only one kiln did not stop the development of Chinese porcelain, and even made it more prosperous.

                <h3>MING DYNASTY</h3>
				<h2> 1368AD - 1644AD</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Ming Dynasty, blue and white porcelain workmanship achieved its pinnacle in Chinese blue and white porcelain development and still, Jingdezhen occupied most of the market. On the basis of the Song and Yuan eras, the porcelain firing technique in Jingdezhen was substantially improved, and the porcelain producing technology was fully developed. Simultaneously, Chinese porcelain during the Ming Dynasty opened up the realm of color porcelain, from single color glaze to multi-color glaze. Jingdezhen was more active during this time and produced porcelain in a variety of hues, grouped into four categories: underglaze color, overglaze color, bucket color, and single-color glaze.

                <h3>QING DYNASTY</h3>
				<h2> 1636AD - 1912AD</h2>
                <p>There is no specific period characteristic of porcelain in the Qing Dynasty, because at that time porcelain development was very comprehensive and popular throughout the country. If have to find out the subtle changes in porcelain style in this dynasty, Qing dynasty porcelain’s style trends mostly changed according to the emperor's preferences. Whatever porcelain the emperor liked and promoted would be popular throughout the country in several years. In addition, from the 17th century, Chinese porcelain, especially blue and white porcelain, was also exported to Europe. Holland was the first country to import Chinese porcelain, and their porcelain trade set off a wave of porcelain in Europe. Since then, Chinese porcelain has become famous around the world.</p>
